# Gloom
A 3D "game" made with 2D raycasting. Name is a play on DOOM (even though DOOM doesn't use raycasting. I didn't know that when I named it lol)

It'll make 2 windows, the raycast view and the "game" view. Press ESC to close them.

Another old project that I just recently added to the GitHub

You can make your own maps in the map builder (in the folder called map builder)
